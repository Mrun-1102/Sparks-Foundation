# Sparks-Foundation
This repository contains the tasks that I have done as an intern at The Sparks Foundation.

Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
Internship Duration - 1 Month ( GripNovember-2021 )



# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML:

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w
You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?



# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML:

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
Use R or Python or perform this task.
Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j



# Task-3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

# Task-4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism:

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
Data can be found at https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)



# Task-5 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports:

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’
As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.
Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)

# Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm:

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
